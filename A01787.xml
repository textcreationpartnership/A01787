            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

But neither the de≈øire of liuing which he enioyed, the ≈øorrow of his right wor≈øhipfull Wife, nor the pitteous mone of his ≈øweet children, might remooue his ≈øetled determination from his intended voyage, which he vndertooke this la≈øt yeare, for the Ilands of the <hi>Suryes</hi> and <hi>Canaryes,</hi> whether at his departure hee framed his cour≈øe, giuing the like directions to his Pinnis, who he was enforced to leaue behinde him at <hi>Douer,</hi> to repaire ≈øome wants, but he neuer ≈øawe hir ≈øince, by the negligence of the Mai≈øter and Captaine which he left in her, to no little greefe of the Gentleman, &amp; no ≈ømall di≈øcomfort to all his company.</p>
            <p>All things furni≈øhed for his voiage, the great commander of the heauens and ≈øeas, fauouring his enterpri≈øe, he ≈øet ≈øaile from <hi>Douer</hi> roade, hauing the winde large at North Ea≈øt, which continued ≈øo eight daies, ≈øo that it freed him from our coa≈øt. Thus happily he recouered the Cape, and from thence to the Ilands, there ≈øpending his time, dooing ≈ømall good, vntill <hi>Nouember,</hi> abiding many ≈øharpe ≈øtormes of winde and weather, which they continued, when many were enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to for≈øake the Ilandes, and returne home, keeping the Spani≈øh coa≈øt, without dooing any thing an≈øwerable to his valiant minde, loathing to returne without dooing ≈øome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable exploite, a≈øwell for honour of his Countrey, as his reputation, his men, healthfull and in good liking, for whom was his cheefe≈øt care, for that he would profit them, who≈øe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing is thereby maintained, their wiues and families, extee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their good, more then his owne lo≈ø≈øe, which was likely to be of no ≈ømall importe.</p>
            <p>Houering betweene the Ilandes, commaunded by the har≈øhnes of the windes, to ≈øeeke his be≈øt ≈øafetie, hauing little cha≈øe or none, and de≈øirous to releeue his companies with ≈øuch fre≈øh vittels as the Ilandes affords, he mo≈øt valiantlye accompted, to land on Saint <hi>Georges Iland.</hi> And hauing
<pb facs="tcp:21019:3"/>
coun≈øelled with his company thereof, they were all willing, as men that loue him, both for his valoure and courte≈øie, to follow him, in what ≈øeruice ≈øo euer, all condi≈øcending to hys will, he cau≈øeth ≈øpeedy preparation to be made for the ≈øame. And hauing a ≈ømall Caruill, which he had taken before at his ≈øtarne, for that ≈øhe drewe little water, was the fitter for the landing his companies: All things prouided, they attend but the tide for their be≈øt aduantage, and neere vpon a full ≈øea, he halled vp his long Boate and the Caruell, into which ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red foure ≈øcore and ≈øixe men, 60 Shot, the re≈øt Pikes, blacke Billes, and other warlike abilliments, and in Gods name commit them≈øelues to their good fortunes.</p>
            <p>The watch of the Iland, perceiuing theyr comming neere the ≈øhore, with their Ship, more then commonly any ≈øtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger dooth, had before giuen warnings, that the mo≈øt force of the Iland was there, ready to receaue them: which our men perceaued, yet could not be daunted with the ≈øight of them, but valiantly put forwards, attempting to land where they were mo≈øt ≈øharpely encountered by the enemie. But the Gunner taking aduantage, with a Sacare from the Ship, charged with a Chaine, made ≈øo good a ≈øhoote, that hee flew and di≈ømembred tenne or twelue, who ≈øeeing his ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øe aun≈øwerable to his de≈øire, hee playde ≈øtill vpon them with his Ordnance from the Shippe, which made them the ≈øooner to retire, ≈øo that the whole conflict at the fir≈øt landing, continued not pa≈øt two houres, when the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards heartes began to quaile, and his men to bee of more courage, which the Spaniards perceauing, ≈øounded a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate, and with all ≈øpeede, fled into the hie Countreyes, ≈øo thankes be to God, they ended onely with the lo≈ø≈øe of two men, be≈øides ≈øome hurt, yet did they great ≈øpoile among≈øt the Spaniards.</p>
            <p>Being landed, and night at hande, they had no pollicie, to per≈øue them, wherefore marching into the lande a Mile or ≈øomething le≈ø≈øe, they encamped them≈øelues, di≈øpear≈øing ≈øundrye Sentenels, for watche, farre from the Campe,
<pb facs="tcp:21019:4"/>
diuers wayes, keeping a ≈øtrong watch in campe. That if the enimie ≈øhould haue come vpon them in the night, they might haue beene ready to receiue them.</p>
            <p>But the Spaniards, hauing ≈øo bad a banquetiat their fir≈øt meetings, had no ha≈øt to come againe. Day being come, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Glemham</hi> commaunded certaine e≈øpials to be ≈øent out, to ≈øee if they could de≈øcrie the enemie, but they returned with little newes, ≈øauing they ≈øaw many armed in no araye, and diuers women and children, carrying goods to hide.</p>
            <p>Vpon this newes, that worthy Gentleman, and braue Captaine, Mai≈øter <hi>Edward Horecourt</hi> his a≈ø≈øociate in tho≈øe his Voyages, willed the Generall to deuide the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and he would lead the one of them: and ≈øo with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øignes di≈øplayed, to march in warlike order farther vp, to ≈øee what they would do: which coun≈øell the Generall accepted, and with ea≈øie paces marched on, largely di≈øtanted one from the other, to make them ≈øeeme farre more in number then they were, with Drums, Trumpets, and two En≈øignes di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaid, yeeling ≈øuch terrible cryes as they marched, as might terrifie a great company.</p>
            <p>The Generall gouerned by Captaine <hi>Horecourt,</hi> who≈øe experience in land ≈øeruice is much, hauing had charge of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in the Low-countreys, Ireland, and Portingall, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wholy directed by him, the two Companies marched in ≈øort like two wings, with intent and full re≈øolution, if there came ten men for one, to encounter them, and valiantly to die together, or gaine honour for euer with the enemie.</p>
            <p>They had not marched halfe a league, when making a ≈øtand for ≈øome parley, the e≈øpyals brought word they ≈øawe one come, mounted as if he came to ≈øpeake with them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Generall ≈øent a Guarde of Mu≈øketeares to meete him, and to ≈øtay him, if he had any thing to ≈øaye, for that hee ≈øhould not take view of their forces. When he came to this Courte of Guarde appointed to meete him: they demanded what he was? Who an≈øwered, he had to ≈øay to their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and Captaines, and de≈øired to be brought to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence,
<pb facs="tcp:21019:4"/>
they ≈øtaide him there, and ≈øent worde to the Generall what hee was, who came accompanied with foure other Gentlemen, and his whole noi≈øe of Trumpets, mo≈øt brauely to ≈øpeake with him.</p>
            <p>After entertainment giuen him in the be≈øt manner, for that he ≈øeemed ≈øome <hi>Cauelere,</hi> hee aduerti≈øed the Generall that he came from the Gouernour, to know what they were, and what they required.</p>
            <p>The General v≈øing him kindely, gaue him milde ≈øpeeches, but willed him to returne his aun≈øwer thus. That he was a Gentleman of England, &amp; what he pretended, he would not impart to any priuate man: but if the Gouernor would come him≈øelfe, he promi≈øed on the honour of an Engli≈øh Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he ≈øhould pa≈ø≈øe and repa≈ø≈øe in ≈øafetie: if hee gaue not credit to his worde, ho≈øtage of reputation, Gentlemen of his countrie, no whit inferiour to the be≈øt Spaniard in the Ile, ≈øhould be deliuered for him.</p>
            <p>With this an≈øwer, the Me≈ø≈øenger ha≈øtneth to the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: Who calling his Coun≈øell, required their opinions, who≈øe adui≈øes giuen, he came towards the Campe, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with twelue others, well mounted, about ≈øome halfe mile from the Court of Guarde, they made ≈øtaye, and ≈øent vnto the Generall for his ho≈øtages, who ss he promi≈øed, ≈øent a Gentleman, that ≈øometimes attended the Earle of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wike, Mai≈øter <hi>Hammon,</hi> one Mai≈øter <hi>Gore,</hi> and Mai≈øter <hi>Hunnings,</hi> Guarded with twentie Mu≈øketeares, who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the Gentlemen, and receaued the Gouernour, conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to a place where the Generall made his ≈øtay, di≈øtant from his Campe.</p>
            <p>Being mette, and hauing a while conferred, the General demanded to haue the Iland deliuered him, vnto the Queen of Englands v≈øe, which if they would, they ≈øhould haue liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to depart with what they had there in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, if not, to commit it to the ha≈ø≈øard of the ≈øworde, for what aduantuge he had, he would keepe, or die for it: and what ≈øpoile he could make they ≈øhould be a≈ø≈øured of.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:21019:5"/>This demaund the Gouernour flatlye denyed, alledging he was a Gentleman, and ≈øworne to the King his Mai≈øter, as the Generall for the Queene of England, and that before his allegiance therein ≈øhould quaile, he would die with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour like a Gentleman. Yet quoth he, as ye are a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and will fauour me heereafter, what there is in the Ile will do you plea≈øure, commaund it, condicionally that your companies ≈øpoyle not the Kings ≈øubiects, nor theyr goods, which rather then I may endure, I will hazzard all to my good Fortunes.</p>
            <p>The Generall for that he vnder≈øtood not the Spani≈øh, was compelled to v≈øe an enterpretor, wherefore that hee might ≈øpeake his owne minde, he demaunded of the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour if he ≈øpake Lattin, which he did excellent well, ≈øo in lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, which the Generall ≈øpeakes as perfect as Engli≈øh, hee confermed what he had before ≈øpoken and no more.</p>

            <p>That con≈øidering he was a Gentleman, which helde his reputation in ≈øome accompt with his Mai≈øter the King, and that it might greatly blemi≈øh his credit, if they ≈øhould bid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> battell and ouerthrow them, of which by Gods helpe he was a≈ø≈øured, he had with earne≈øt reque≈øt per≈øwaded the company to giue ouer their aduantage, on tho≈øe conditions pre≈øently to be performed, <hi>viz.</hi> That they ≈øhould haue of victuals of al ≈øorts the Iland affordeth, ≈øufficient for the vitteling the ≈øhip, and 1000 Crownes among≈øt them, to be deuided in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the lo≈ø≈øe of their men ≈ølaine at their landing.</p>
            <p>To tho≈øe conditions the Gouernour condi≈øcended, and on his credit to deliuer it in one daies re≈øpect this matter ended.

            <p>The Gouernor being departed, order was taken for the watche, which was ≈øet in diuers places, for feare of treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the night. About two houres in the night, a Trumpet ≈øounded a parley neere the Campe, which ≈øo amazed them, that they were greatly in doubt of the Spaniards tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, and betooke them all to armes pre≈øently.
